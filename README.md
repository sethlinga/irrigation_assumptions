This is the R code of the paper, whose abstract is the following:

Many global water models contain an irrigation module that simulates irrigation water withdrawals based on several assumptions on climate conditions, crop management, soil moisture, irrigation practices or water source. However, we do not know how many of these assumptions are grounded on empirical data and how many are pragmatic; that is, based on practical considerations rather than on observational evidence. Here we address this issue through the lens of sensitivity auditing and philosophy of science and analyse 50 studies across nine global irrigation models (GIM), identifying a total of 103 assumptions. Our results suggest that 70% of these assumptions are pragmatic, 35% are shared by multiple models, and that most of the assumptions shared are also pragmatic. This indicates that the uncertainty space of GIMs may be larger than previously thought as pragmatic assumptions can be altered without compromising the model's representational capacity. Our findings underscore the need for systematic appraisal of model assumptions to enhance transparency and improve the robustness of GIMs for decision-making in water resource management and policy.
